> 1. [Linear Regression from Scratch](https://hyperskill.org/projects/195?track=28) --> [my solution](https://github.com/ahsanyusob/hyperskill-python-intro-ML/blob/master/challenging/Linear%20Regression%20From%20Scratch/regression.py)  
> 
> | No | Tasks |  
> | --- | --- |  
> | 1 | Load a pandas DataFrame containing features X and target y |  
> | 2 | Create a CustomLinearRegression Class with: (1) fit, predict, r2_score and rmse methods, and (2) intercept and coefficient attributes |  
> | 3 | Initialize instances of CustomLinearRegression and LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model |  
> | 4 | Fit the data by passing features X and target y to both regression models |  
> | 5 | Predict y for the other feature datasets |  
> | 6 | Calculate RMSE and R2 metrics for both regression models |  
> | 7 | Determine the intercept and coefficient of both regression models and calculate their differences |  
>
